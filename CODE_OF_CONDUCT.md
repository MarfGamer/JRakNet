# Politically Neutral Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of keeping our environment as safe and our software
as high of quality as possible, we as contributors and maintainers
pledge to making participation in our project and our community a place
for focusing on code and forwarding the progress of the software. The needless
injection of politics to the community of the project will not be tolerated.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being respectful towards each other
* Focusing on the project itself, rather than the politics of other users
* Giving credit where credit is due based on actual accomplishments.
* Giving people official positions in the project based on their skill and
  character as a person.
  
Examples of unnaceptable behavior by particpants include:

* Being disrespectful towards each other for any reason
* The needless injection of politics into the project or its community
* Expecting special treatment based on anything other than merit.

## Our Responsibilities

We as the project maintainers are not responsible for behavior conducted by others.
We will try our best to make sure that the community environment is safe, but we will
not be held accountable for other people’s actions as it is not our job to prevent them
from doing so. We also reserve the right, but not responsibility, to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions in any way we
see fit and to temporarily or permanently ban users for any reason.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. However, if this is not the case,
individuals shall not be punished within the project space for actions that they
have committed outside of said project space. Doing so shall be forbidden except
under extreme circumstances (such as the individual in question being involved
in illegal activities), as it is only harmful to the project environment.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. We will try,
but will not guarantee, to review and investigate all complaints and respond
how we deem necessary. We do however reserve the right and responsibility to
maintain the confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident __unless it
is deemed necessary to make it public for any reason__.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of project’s
leadership.
