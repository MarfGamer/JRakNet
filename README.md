# JRakNet
JRakNet is a networking library for Java which implements the UDP based protocol [RakNet](https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet).
This library was meant to be used for Minecraft: Pocket Edition servers and clients, but can still be used to create game servers
and clients for other video games with ease.
